\chapter{Introduction}
This paper seeks to introduce the state of the art of pervasive games, with additional background in Internet of Things (IoT) and pervasive/ubiquitous computing in general. By looking at the state of the art of these topics the paper seeks to present an overview of current issues, use, and trends within each of the domains. In addition to a presentation of the state of the art, the paper will also present a case where IoT is utilized to create a proof of concept for a framework of 'things' that is intended to be utilized in the development of pervasive games. As well as the framework the paper also presents some of the hardware used in the proof, and elaborate on how these 'things' simplify prototyping and proof of concept processes. Lastly the paper will discuss some of the challenges related to the topic of IoT and pervasive games, and present some suggestions for further research in the domain.
