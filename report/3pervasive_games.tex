% What is pervasive games

% History of pervasive games, three different generations \cite{Kasapakis_pervasivegaming}
% Gen1 (2002-2009): custom equpment, wearable computers, PDAs, feature phones
% Gen2 (2009-2014): smartphones
% Gen3 (2014-..): Wearables (glasses, smart watches, health bands), smartphones
	% IoT for Pervasive Games in Gen3, data collection, sensing etc.
    % Introduce technology? (rfduino, arduino, tessel, etc.)
    
% Issues with Pervasive Games
	% Sofa gaming \cite{{10.1109/MPRV.2006.11}
    % Ability to play the game without disturbing social contexts
	% “Those two subjects’ decision to play the game during what they classify as work time seems to run contrary to how people generally separate activities into work and recreation, pursued at separate times. This observation calls for further research considering pervasive gaming’s anytime, anywhere aspect to clarify to what extent pervasive games might challenge people’s conception of social contexts and related activities. The empirical results lead to a design implication: the “mobile, place-independent game play” idea might benefit from being turned inside out. That is, we should consider place- or location dependent game design in which players must move around at a specific location (instead of being able to play the game “anywhere,” which in our study was realized in most cases through “sofa gaming”).”
